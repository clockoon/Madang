# Madang

Madang (마당) is a Korean word for 'Garden'.

Madang is based on the famous, future-proof wiki software [DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org).

Madang is not for [Digital Garden](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/), although some users will utilize it as 'gardening'.

Currently Madang's repository is used for [C20](https://c20.kr)'s development.
